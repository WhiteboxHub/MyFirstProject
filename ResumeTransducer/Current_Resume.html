<p />
<p><b>Project:</b> <b>GIS System</b></p>
<p />
<p><b>Senior Design Developer</b> - Using a third party geocoding API, an object oriented program was designed that used the File Scripting Object for file access and a class that managed individual record processing.  A large text file was opened, each fixed field record was appropriately parsed and fed into the API.  The API return values were concatenated per requirements to construct a geocode that PacBell used to determine high cost phone lines. Throughout the process, logs were updated and VBA was used to construct Excel spreadsheets.  This application processed 10,000 records per minute.</p>
<p />
<p><b>Project: DBUpdate</b></p>
<p />
<p>Depending on the type of geocoding (there were four types) a SQL Server database was updated to reflect the new type and effective date.  </p>
<p>The old program was modified by replacing RDO with ADO and moving the SQL into a stored procedure.</p>
